# Dual Account Script

#### What is Dual Account?
Using a Single Account deployment method, delays may be incurred in edge cases such as when a password is requested exactly when CPM is changing that password.
The Dual Account deployment method eliminates any edge case delays that may be encountered when using a single account.
Dual Accounts ensures no such delays are incurred when the application needs credentials because a password that is currently used by an application will never be changed. This is especially recommended in high load and critical applications.

Dual Account ensures seamless, safe access to a system, database, or application. With this type of account rotation, there are no blackout periods when passwords expire.
For more information, see [here](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-CP/Latest/en/Content/CP%20and%20ASCP/cv_Managing-Dual-Accounts.htm?TocPath=Administration%7CCredential%20Provider%7CAccounts%20and%20Safes%7CManage%20Dual%20Accounts%7C_____0).

## General

This script enables fully automatic configuration for the dual account feature.

**_Notice:_** In Privilege Cloud Shared Services environment, only password authentication method is supported.

## Requirements
- This scripts can run against Vault and PVWA v12.1 and up.
- The script is used to create and configure new accounts as dual account. It does not configure existing account as dual account.
  - Verify the accounts you wish to configure as dual account does not exist in the Vault you are working with.

## Limitations

- This script can run on Windows Server 16 and later versions only, due to incompatible cipher suites in earlier versions.

- This script supports only platforms (in PVWA environment) with the following properties:
   - Address
   - Username
   - Password
   - Account
   
   If your platform has other mandatory properties, [configure dual account manually](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-CP/Latest/en/Content/CP%20and%20ASCP/cv_Automatic_dual_account.htm?tocpath=Administration%7CCredential%20Provider%7CAccounts%20and%20Safes%7CManage%20Dual%20Accounts%7C_____1)

## Use Dual Account Script

### Step 1 - Fill in Policy-DualAccount-Creation.json
**Policy-DualAccount-Creation.json** is the configuration file for the script that creates dual accounts. 
It contains all mandatory and optional properties of your dual accounts.

Before you run the script fill in the required details as follows:

**The following table list the parameters in this file:**

https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PrivCloud-SS/latest/en/Content/WebServices/ISP-Auth-APIs.htm#APIURLstructure

- Fill in Policy-DualAccount-Creation.json optional properties

### Step 2 - Run the Dual Account Creation script
The Dual Account Creation script (DualAccount-Creation.ps1) creates and performs the necessary changes on the platform and in the account properties to enable the accounts to work as a dual accounts pair.

#### Usage
```powershell
DualAccount-Creation.ps1 -PASUserName <string> -PASPassword <string> -AccountList <string> -AuthenticationType <string> -ConfigFileFullPath <string>
```

For the **AccountList** combine the username, IP address and password or path of SSH key file including file name as follows:
```
[USER_NAME1]@[IP_ADDRESS]@[PASSWORD];[USER_NAME2]@[IP_ADDRESS]@[PASSWORD]
```
or
 ```
 [USER_NAME1]@[IP_ADDRESS]@[SSH_KEY_PATH];[USER_NAME2]@[IP_ADDRESS]@[SSH_KEY_PATH]
 ```
 
For Privilege Cloud Shared Services environment, run:
```powershell
DualAccount-Creation.ps1 -PASUserName <string> -PASPassword <string> -AccountList <string> -ConfigFileFullPath <string> -TenantName <string>
```

**Note:**
You can view Dual Account creation script's progress and failures in the Console and in the Log file (by default named Log-DualAccount.log). 

**Examples:**
- Run the Dual Account Creation script with mandatory parameters
```powershell
PS C:\Example>> .\DualAccount-Creation.ps1 -PASUserName Administrator -PASPassword ******** -AccountList "user1@1.1.1.1@1234;user2@1.1.1.1@1234"
```
- Run the Dual Account Creation script with 'AuthenticationType' parameter
```powershell
PS C:\Example>> .\DualAccount-Creation.ps1 -PASUserName Administrator -PASPassword ******** -AccountList "user1@1.1.1.1@1234;user2@1.1.1.1@1234" -AuthenticationType cyberark
```
- Run the Dual Account Creation script with 'ConfigFileFullPath' parameter
```powershell
PS C:\Example>> .\DualAccount-Creation.ps1 -PASUserName Administrator -PASPassword ******** -AccountList "user1@1.1.1.1@1234;user2@1.1.1.1@1234" -ConfigFileFullPath C:\\Dual-Accounts-Example\\Config\\Policy-DualAccount-Creation.json
```
- Run the Dual Account Creation script with different account's delimiters
```powershell
PS C:\Example>> .\DualAccount-Creation.ps1 -PASUserName Administrator -PASPassword ******** -AccountList "user1#1.1.1.1#1234,user2#1.1.1.1#1234"
```

#### Optional - Use a different Rotational Group platform for your dual account pair
If you want to use a different rotation group platform than the default one, follow these steps:
  - When the script has finished running, log on to the PVWA as admin.
  - Duplicate the Rotational Group platform and change **GracePeriod** as desired.
  - For each dual account pair that should work with the new Rotational Group, and update its Rotational Group Platform with the duplicated platform


### Step 3 - Test your dual account pair
- In PVWA > Accounts > Accounts Details, select your dual account pair.
- Select one of the accounts and on the CPM tab, click Display. Both accounts appear in the same group, where one accounts is active and the other is inactive (see the Status field). 
- Using the dual account pair's virtual username, retrieve the dual account pair's password. The password retrieved should be the password of the active account.
- Trigger a CPM rotation for one of the accounts or wait for this to happen on it's own.
- Once again, using the dual account pair's virtual username, retrieve the dual account pair's password.
- Verify the currently active account is the account that was inactive before.
